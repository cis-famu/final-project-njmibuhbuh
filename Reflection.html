            <h2>My Creative Journey</h2>
            <p>A space for contemplation and sharing insights from my artistic and personal growth.</p>
                <h3>Struggles</h3>
    <p>I had trouble balancing multiple projects at once. I also had great struggle connecting images on HTML projects. Lastly, I struggled using GitHub.</p>

    <h3>Lessons</h3>
    <p>Some lessons I learned are to not be afraid of taking leadership in a group project. Another Lesson I learned was to take things one at a time. I was often overwhelmed when multiple assignments and prodjects were going on, but learning to focus at one thing at a time helped.</p>

    <h3>Growth</h3>
    <p>Some growth I had was learning to code in html and make websites. This was really fun and I believe it will help my resume stand out.</p>
